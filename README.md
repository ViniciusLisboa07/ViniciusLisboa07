<p align="center">Hi there! I'm <b>Vinicius</b></p>
<p align="center">
  <i>I like to create things â€” and I use software development to make them real.</i>

### Tech Stack

I usually use:

- **Ruby on Rails**
- **Relational Databases** (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **React**

I also have some experience with **Angular**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and other technologies I came across during college.  
I'm always interested in deepening my knowledge in **web development** and improving my craft as a full-stack developer.

I occasionally write about development, ideas, and experiments here in [my blog](https://viniciuslisboa07.github.io/blog)
